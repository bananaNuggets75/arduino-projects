## Introduction

Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. It's great for beginners and experts alike who want to create interactive projects. This repository aims to provide a curated selection of Arduino projects, complete with compiled programs (.hex files), to simplify the learning process and encourage experimentation.

## Getting Started

To get started with these projects, you'll need the following:

- An Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno, Arduino Nano, etc.)
- The Arduino IDE installed on your computer ([Download Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software))
- USB cable to connect your Arduino board to your computer
- Basic understanding of Arduino programming (C/C++)

To run a project:

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `.hex` file corresponding to the project you want to upload to your Arduino board.
3. Connect your Arduino board to your computer via USB.
4. Open the Arduino IDE.
5. Click on **File > Open** and navigate to the location where you downloaded the `.hex` file.
6. Select the `.hex` file and click **Open**.
7. Click on **Tools > Board** and select the appropriate board type.
8. Click on **Tools > Port** and select the port to which your Arduino board is connected.
9. Click on the **Upload** button to upload the program to your Arduino board.

## Project List

Below is a list of projects included in this repository:

1. Ultrasonic Distance Sensor
2. ... (add more projects as necessary)

Each project directory contains a README file with a brief description of the project and its components.

### Project: Distance Detector

- **Description:** This project utilizes an ultrasonic sensor to detect the distance of an object from the sensor.
- **Components:** Arduino Uno, Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04), Breadboard, Jumper Wires
- **Compiled Program:** [distance_detector.hex](projects/distance_detector/distance_detector.hex)

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have an Arduino project with a compiled program (.hex file) that you would like to share, please follow these steps:

1. Fork this repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature/add-new-project`).
3. Add your project folder containing the compiled program and a README.md file describing the project.
4. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add new project: Project Name'`).
5. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/add-new-project`).
6. Create a new Pull Request.

## Cloning the Repository

You can clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
